# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using features like age, class, fare, and more.

It uses the Titanic dataset from the Seaborn library (based on the original Kaggle dataset), and applies basic preprocessing, feature encoding, and classification using a Random Forest model.

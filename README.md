# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using features like age, class, fare, and more.

It uses the Titanic dataset from the Seaborn library (based on the original Kaggle dataset), and applies basic preprocessing, feature encoding, and classification using a Random Forest model.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waterloooooo/titanic_survival_prediction.git
cd titanic_survival_prediction
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

You can install the required libraries with:

## 📊 Features Used

* `pclass` – Passenger class
* `sex` – Gender
* `age` – Age
* `sibsp` – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* `parch` – Number of parents/children aboard
* `fare` – Fare paid
* `embarked` – Port of embarkation

---

## ✅ Model

* **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier
* **Accuracy**: Varies by split, typically around \~80%

---

## 📌 Notes

* Missing values in `age` and `embarked` are filled with median and mode respectively.
* Categorical features like `sex` and `embarked` are label-encoded.
* You can easily swap the model with others from `sklearn` like `LogisticRegression` or `SVC`.
